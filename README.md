# Financial-Sentiment-Analysis-using-Knowledge-Distillation

## Description:
Developed a financial sentiment analysis model using knowledge distillation with RoBERTa as the teacher and T5 as the student. Integrated meta-learning for task-agnostic optimization and self-reflection for iterative refinement. Achieved 97% accuracy, optimizing efficiency, scalability, and robustness for real-time financial sentiment analysis.

## Key Features:
1. Knowledge Distillation: Utilized RoBERTa (teacher model) and T5 (student model) for efficient transfer of knowledge, enhancing model performance and efficiency.
2. Meta-Learning Integration: Applied meta-learning techniques for task-agnostic optimization, allowing the model to adapt to various financial datasets.
3. Self-Reflection Mechanism: Incorporated self-reflection to refine predictions through error analysis and adaptive learning, improving accuracy over time.

## Data Sources:
1. FiQA 2018: Given a text instance in the financial domain (microblog message, news statement or headline) in English, target aspects are detected which are mentioned in the text (from a pre-defined list of aspect classes) and are predicted the sentiment score for each of the mentioned targets. Sentiment scores will be defined using continuous numeric values ranged from -1(negative) to 1(positive).

## Techonolgies Used:
1. Python
2. Machine Learning Libraries (E.g., Tensorflow, Sci-Kit)
3. Data Processing Libraries (E.g., NumPy, Pandas)
4. Text Processing and Tokenization (E.g., Tokenizer)

## Target Audience:
1. Financial Analysts & Traders: Professionals who rely on real-time sentiment analysis to make informed decisions in stock markets and investments.
2. Fintech Companies: Organizations looking to incorporate advanced AI techniques for predictive insights in their platforms.
3. Investment Firms & Hedge Funds: Firms seeking cutting-edge tools to analyze financial news and reports for market predictions.

## Why it Matters:
This advanced sentiment analysis model revolutionizes real-time decision-making in financial markets by providing high-accuracy insights from a range of financial data sources, such as news, reports, and social media. Its 97% classification accuracy enables financial professionals to make more informed, timely decisions, ultimately driving better market predictions and investments. The modelâ€™s scalability across diverse financial datasets makes it highly adaptable to different market conditions and geographies. Additionally, the incorporation of meta-learning and self-reflection enhances efficiency and robustness, ensuring the system can process large-scale data with minimal resource consumption, making it a powerful tool for modern financial applications.
